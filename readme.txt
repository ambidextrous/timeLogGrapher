Simple Python script to produce a graph of data-set of sleep-time information using the matplotlib library. 

The dataset used should be a .csv database with the following form:

    SleepStartDate,SleepStartTime,SleepStopTime
    17/03/2017,23:45,07:25
    19/03/2017,01:05,09:10
    19/03/2017,23:50,08:25

Visualisation shows hours of the day on the y-axis and calendar days on the x-axis.
