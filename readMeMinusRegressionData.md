# Wee Baby, Big Data

## Statistical analysis versus child-based insomnia: a parental survival aid

Rougly hacked together Python scripts to visualise sleep patterns and analyse the relationship between daytime sleep patterns and those of the subsequent night.

`graphActivities.py` produces a graphical representation a of data-set of time spent carrying out daily activities, using the matplotlib library. 

`analyseData.py` processes the activity data into `dataItem` objects containing daily sleep time and duration information. Then produces graphical represtentions of said data items and carries out a regression analysis to determine daily sleep patterns corresponding with increased or decreased sleep over the following night.

No UI developed as of yet, so alterations need to be made directly to Python files.

## Why?

### Sleep schedule visualisation

Babies are creatures of habit. The aim of this graph is to let you see what your baby's habits are, so that you understand what's going on and better plan your day. It also allows you to get a visual representation of what daytime sleep patterns are most conducive to your baby (and you) getting a good night's sleep, e.g. does your baby tend to sleep better if put to bed at 22:00 or 23:00? Obviously a lot of this stuff is pretty intuitive and common-sensical, but the graph can be a helpful way of looking at a large ammount of information in a single glance.

### Anaylsis

The analysis script follows on from the graphic representation, its aim is to break down the data used to make the graph in different visual and statistical ways to bring out information that may not be immediately apparent from the main visualisation. E.g. it examines whether longer daytime naps correllate with a baby's getting more sleep at night in a statistically significant way.

## Use Instructions

Written in Python 2.7.

Activities over time visualisation:

    python graphActivities.py

Analysis processing and visualisation:

	python analyseData.py

## Input
 
The dataset used should be one or more `.csv` files with the following format:

    SleepStartDate,SleepStartTime,SleepStopTime
    17/03/17,23:45,07:25
    19/03/17,01:05,09:10
    19/03/17,23:50,08:25

Visualisation shows hours of the day on the y-axis and calendar days on the x-axis.
