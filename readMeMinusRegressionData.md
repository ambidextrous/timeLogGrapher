## Statistical analysis versus child-based insomnia: a parental survival aid

Rougly hacked together Python scripts to visualise sleep patterns and analyse the relationship between daytime sleep patterns and those of the subsequent night

`graphActivities.py` produces a graphical representation a of data-set of time spent carrying out daily activities, using the matplotlib library. 

`analyseData.py` processes the activity data into `dataItem` objects containing daily sleep time and duration information. Then produces graphical represtentions of said data items and carries out a regression analysis to determine daily sleep patterns corresponding with increased or decreased sleep over the following night.

## Use Instructions

Written in Python 2.7.

Activities over time visualisation:

    python graphActivities.py

Analysis processing and visualisation:

	python analyseData.py

## Input
 
The dataset used should be one or more `.csv` files with the following format:

    SleepStartDate,SleepStartTime,SleepStopTime
    17/03/17,23:45,07:25
    19/03/17,01:05,09:10
    19/03/17,23:50,08:25

Visualisation shows hours of the day on the y-axis and calendar days on the x-axis.
